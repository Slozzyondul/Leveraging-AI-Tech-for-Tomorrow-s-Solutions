# Targets Features

1. Early Warning System

Integrate AI models that analyze real-time data from sources like satellites, weather stations, and seismic sensors.
Provide alerts for natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and wildfires.
Implement predictive analytics to forecast potential disaster zones.

2. Risk Assessment and Mapping

Use AI to analyze geographical data and identify high-risk areas.
Develop detailed risk maps that highlight vulnerable infrastructure and populations.

3. Community Preparedness

Create personalized emergency preparedness plans based on location and risk level.
Deliver educational resources (videos, checklists) tailored to specific disasters.
Use AI chatbots to answer community queries about disaster preparedness.

4. Real-Time Resource Allocation

Develop algorithms to optimize resource distribution (shelter, food, medical supplies) during a disaster.
Integrate with local authorities and NGOs for efficient collaboration.

5. Damage Assessment

Leverage drones and AI for real-time damage assessment after disasters.
Automate the identification of affected areas, infrastructure damage, and casualty estimations.

6. Crowdsourced Data Collection

Enable community members to upload images, videos, and reports of the disaster.
Use AI to analyze this data to improve situational awareness.

7. Healthcare and Medical Assistance

Integrate telemedicine features for immediate medical consultation.
Predict disease outbreaks following disasters using AI analytics on environmental data.

# Technology Stack

- Frontend (Flutter)

- Backend (Flask)

- Database (SQL)

# How To Run
1. Backend 
- open mockModel.py in integrated then run "python3 mockModel.py"
- open app.py in another integrated then run "python3 app.py"
- open separate terminal and start mariadb server 
- create a database called "disaster_alerts.db" 
- create all the tables as per table.sql file

2. Frontend
- open root folder of the project in integrated then run "flutter run"
